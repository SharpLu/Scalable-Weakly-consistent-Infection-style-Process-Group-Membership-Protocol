SWIM through the NATs

March 31, 2015
The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate a decentralized
membership service that provides information about all the the participating
processes. A membership service can easily be implemented using
a heatbeat mechanism, where each process periodically sends a ping message
to all the processes in the system. Failures are detected when a process
does not responds to the ping message. However, this solution does
not scale well when the number of processes in the system grow because
heatbeat based mechanisms requires O(n2) messages in each round.
The project is split into two phases. In the first phase of the project
you will implement SWIM: Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style
Group Membership Protocol [1] using Kompics that scales to at least
hundreds of peers in simulation. In phase two you will modify the system
to make with work on the Open Internet.
1 Phase 1: Implementing and Evaluating SWIM
Warm Up: Ping Pong
The bootstrap mechanism provides a small subset of existing peers in the
system. A new peer injects information about itself by randomly pinging one
of the peers provided by the bootstrap server. Implement a basic ping pong
mechanism. Select a random peer from the list of alive nodes and send a ping
message. When a peer receives a ping message it responds back with a pong
message. Using the log messages make sure that the ping mechanism is working.
Task 1: Membership discovery
In this task you will implement the piggybacking mechanism to disseminate
information about new peers in the system. In the pong messages the peers
piggyback information about the changes (new/dead/suspected peers) in the
system. Upon receiving the pong message the new information is merged with
the local state stored in one or more local lists.
The authors recommend exchanging the new information
